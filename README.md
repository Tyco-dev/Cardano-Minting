## Step 1: Set up Linux environment
#### Hardware requirements:
- Min 2 vCPU
- Min 12gb of RAM (recommend 16gb)
- 50gb+ of disk space
#### VPS providers:
- [Contabo](https://contabo.com/en/) (What I prefer to use)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

For this guide, I will be using Ubuntu 20.04

Once you set up your VPS and retreive your login information, ssh into your VPS.
```
ssh root@ip-address
```
